conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public
License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You
are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions,

     Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
     moving image.
</li>
<li> <u>Copyright and Similar Rights</u> means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
     copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui
     Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For
     purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section <a href="#2b1">2(b)(1)</a>-
     <a href="#2b2">(2)</a> are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
</li>
<li> <u>Effective Technological Measures</u> means those measures that, in the absence of proper

</li>
<li> <u>Exceptions and Limitations</u> means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or

     License.
</li>

     or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed
     Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or
     similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
     connection with the exchange.
</li>
<li> <u>Share</u> means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires
     permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance,
     distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to
     the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
     and at a time individually chosen by them.
</li>
<li> <u>Sui Generis Database Rights</u> means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
     96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection

     anywhere in the world.
</li>
<li> <u>You</u> means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public
     License. <b>Your</b> has a corresponding meaning.

</ol>

### Section 2 – Scope.

<ol type="a">
<li> <b>License grant.</b>
     <ol type="1">
     <li> <a id="2a1"></a>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
          hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable
          license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
          <ol type="A">
          <li> reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial
               purposes only; and
          </li>
          <li> produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
               only.
          </li>
          </ol>
     </li>
     <li> <b>Exceptions and Limitations.</b> For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
          Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to
          comply with its terms and conditions.
     </li>
     <li> <b>Term.</b> The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          <a href="#6a">6(a)</a>.
     </li>
     <li> <a id="2a4"></a><b>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.</b> The Licensor
          authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
          or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor
          waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
          technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
          modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of
          this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section
          <a href="#2a4">2(a)(4)</a> never produces Adapted Material.
     </li>
     <li> <u>Downstream recipients.</u>
          <ol type="A">
          <li> <u>Offer from the Licensor</u> – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
               Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed
               Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
          </li>
          <li> <u>No downstream restrictions.</u> You may not offer or impose any additional or
               different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
               the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
               recipient of the Licensed Material.
          </li>
          </ol>
     </li>
     <li> <u>No endorsement.</u> Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as
          permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
          connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or
          others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
          <a href="#3a1Ai">3(a)(1)(A)(i)</a>.
     </li>
     </ol>
</li>
<li> <b>Other rights.</b>
     <ol type="1">
     <li> <a id="2b1"></a>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
          Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights;
          however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such
          rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
          Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
     </li>
     <li> <a id="2b2"></a>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
     </li>
     <li> To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for
          the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other
          cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
     </li>
     </ol>
</li>
</ol>

### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

<ol type="a">
<li> <a id="3a"></a><b>Attribution.</b>
     <ol type="1">
     <li> <a id="3a1"></a>If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:
          <ol type="A">
          <li> <a id="3a1A"></a>retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
               Licensed Material:
               <ol type="i">
               <li> <a id="3a1Ai"></a>identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
                    any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested
                    by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
               </li>
               <li> a copyright notice;</li>
               <li> a notice that refers to this Public License;</li>
               <li> a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;</li>
               <li> a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
                    practicable;
               </li>
               </ol>
          </li>
          <li> indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any
               previous modifications; and
          </li>
          <li> indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the
               text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
          </li>
          </ol>
          For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share
          Adapted Material.
     </li>
     <li> You may satisfy the conditions in Section <a href="#3a1">3(a)(1)</a> in any reasonable
          manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
          For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
     </li>
     <li> If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section
          <a href="#3a1A">3(a)(1)(A)</a> to the extent reasonably practicable.
     </li>
     </ol>
</li>
</ol>

### <a id="4"></a>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:

<ol type="a">
<li> for the avoidance of doubt, Section <a href="#2a1">2(a)(1)</a> grants You the right to extract,
     reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for
     NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
</li>
<li> if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You
     have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
</li>
<li> You must comply with the conditions in Section <a href="#3a">3(a)</a> if You Share all or a
     substantial portion of the contents of the database.
</li>
</ol>

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4] supplements and does not replace Your obligations under
this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

### <a id="5"></a>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

<ol type="a">
<li> <b>LESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR
     OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
     OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.
     THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
     PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF
     WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</b>
</li>
<li> <b>TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
     (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES
     ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS
     BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION
     OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</b>
</li>
<li> The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in
     a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
</li>
</ol>

### <a id="6"></a>Section 6 – Term and Termination.

<ol type="a">
<li> <a id="6a"></a>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
     licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under
     this Public License terminate automatically.
</li>
<li> <a id="6b"></a>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
     <a href="#6a">6(a)</a>, it reinstates:
     <ol type="1">
     <li> automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days
          of Your discovery of the violation; or
     </li>
     <li> upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</li>
     </ol>
   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section <a href="#6b">6(b)</a> does not affect any right the
   Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
</li>
<li> For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate
     terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

</li>
<li> Sections <a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>,
     <a href="#7">7</a>, and <a href="#8">8</a> survive termination of this Public License.
</li>
</ol>

### <a id="7"></a>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

<ol type="a">
<li> The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated
     by You unless expressly agreed.
</li>
<li> Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated
     herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
</li>
</ol>

### <a id="8"></a>Section 8 – Interpretation.

<ol type="a">
<li> For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to,
     reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could
     lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
</li>
<li> To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it
     shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the
     provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting
     the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
</li>
<li> No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented
     to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
</li>
<li> Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or
     waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the
     legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
</li>
