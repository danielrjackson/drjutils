# EnumRegex Base Class (2025-06-30)

- Context: Working on "Create EnumRegex base class" task from TASKS.md.
- Changes: Implemented new `EnumRegex` class for regex-backed enums, added tests, exports, and updated TASKS.
- Reasoning: Needed a flexible enum variant for matching strings via regular expressions.
- Mistakes: None.
- Lessons Learned: Keep base classes simple but extensible; tests verify core behavior early.
