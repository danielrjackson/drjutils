# MappedEnum Cleanup (2025-06-23)

- Context: Addressed "Clean up `MappedEnum` imports" task from TASKS.md.
- Changes: Removed unused imports, updated docstrings to use the correct module
  path, and exported `MappedEnum` from `common.types.enums`.
- Reasoning: The module still referenced outdated package names and included an
  unused sentinel import. Exporting `MappedEnum` at the package level simplifies
  imports.
- Mistakes: None.
- Lessons Learned: Keep documentation examples synchronized with the actual
  package structure to avoid confusion.

# Config Path Fixes (2025-06-23)

- Context: Working on "Repair configuration path helpers" task from TASKS.md.
- Changes: Replaced custom `Path` and `Files` helper classes with simple constants (`CONFIG_DIR`, `API_KEYS_FILE`, etc.) and updated imports.
- Reasoning: The helper classes shadowed `pathlib.Path` and built file paths incorrectly.
- Mistakes: None.
- Lessons Learned: Avoid redefining names from standard libraries and prefer straightforward constants for paths.
