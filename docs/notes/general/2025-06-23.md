# Config Path Fixes (2025-06-23)

- Context: Working on "Repair configuration path helpers" task from TASKS.md.
- Changes: Replaced custom `Path` and `Files` helper classes with simple constants (`CONFIG_DIR`, `API_KEYS_FILE`, etc.) and updated imports.
- Reasoning: The helper classes shadowed `pathlib.Path` and built file paths incorrectly.
- Mistakes: None.
- Lessons Learned: Avoid redefining names from standard libraries and prefer straightforward constants for paths.
