# Config Path Fixes (2025-06-23)

- Context: Working on "Repair configuration path helpers" task from TASKS.md.
- Changes: Replaced custom `Path` and `Files` helper classes with simple constants (`CONFIG_DIR`, `API_KEYS_FILE`, etc.) and updated imports.
- Reasoning: The helper classes shadowed `pathlib.Path` and built file paths incorrectly.
- Mistakes: None.
- Lessons Learned: Avoid redefining names from standard libraries and prefer straightforward constants for paths.

# Collections Classes Completed (2025-06-23)

- **Context**: Working on "Finish collections classes" task from `TASKS.md`.
- **Changes**: Rewrote `collection_utils.py` and `collection_assertions.py` to provide working
  collection helpers and assertions. Implemented functions for checking empty
  collections, retrieving element types, and validating mappings. Removed stale
  enum-related placeholders and completed `assert_contains` implementation.
- **Reasoning**: The original files were truncated copies of enumeration utils
  and lacked complete implementations. Basic collection utilities are needed for
  later tasks.
- **Mistakes**: None.
- **Lessons Learned**: Ensure modules are fully implemented before relying on
  them elsewhere.
